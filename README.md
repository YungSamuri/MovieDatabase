# Movie Database
This was an assignment for an intro to web development class. We built the front end for a movie database, and used an api from themoviedb.org to get the data. One notable feature is the scrolling images found on the **details** page of any movie,tv show, or person.

*Note*: The api key is not stored on github for privacy reasons
